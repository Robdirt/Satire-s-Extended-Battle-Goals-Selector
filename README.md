# Satire-s-Extended-Battle-Goals-Selector

A very simple application for Gloomhaven. 

I made this for the single sheet option of the battle goals.

Just double click the executable and it will display random battle goals for you to choose from.

The battle goals given are then written to a text file in the same folder so the will not be chosen again. 

When there are no more battle goals to choose from the file is cleared and it will choose form all of them again.

If you want to clear the list manually all you have to do is delete the file or run the executable with an argument of "clear".
